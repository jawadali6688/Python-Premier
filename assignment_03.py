# Assignment 03
# Due Date and Time: June 21, 12:00 pm
# 1. Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and prints the length of the string.

# user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# count = len(user_input)

# print(f'The count of {user_input} is {count}')





# 2. Write a Python program that takes two string inputs from the user and concatenates them.

# str1 = input("Enter first string: ")
# str2 = input("Enter second string: ")
# concatinated_string = str1 + " " +  str2
# # print("The concatinated string is ", str1 + str2)

# print(f"The concatinated string is {concatinated_string}")





# 3. Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and prints the first and last character of the string.

# user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# first_char = user_input[0]
# last_char = user_input[-1] # last index 

# print(f"The first character of {user_input} is {first_char} and last character is {last_char}")


# 4. Write a Python program that takes two string inputs from the user and checks if the second string is present in the first string.

# str1 = input("Enter first string: ")
# str2 = input("Enter second string: ")

# if str2 in str1:
#     print(f"Yes {str2} is present in {str1}")
    
# else:
#     print(f"{str2} is not present in {str1}")
    


# 5. Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string.

# user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# capitalized_string = user_input.title()

# print(f"Your modified string {capitalized_string}")



# 6. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and prints the number in reverse order.

# user_input = input("Enter an integer: ")
# reversed_int = user_input[::-1]
# print(reversed_int)


# 7. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and counts the number of digits in the number.

# user_input = input("Enter integer: ")

# print(len(user_input))


# 8. Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and prints their sum.

# int1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# int2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# print(int1 + int2)

# 9. Write a Python program that takes three integer inputs from the user and calculates their average.

# int1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
# int2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
# int3 = int(input("Enter third number: "))

# print((int1 + int2 + int3)/3)


# 10. Write a Python program that takes two inputs from the user: a base number and an exponent. The program should calculate and print the result of raising the base number to the power of the exponent.

# base_num = int(input("Enter base number: "))
# power_num = int(input("Enter power number: "))

# formula = base_num ** power_num

# print(formula)


# 11. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and increments it by 1.

# int1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))

# print(int1 + 1)


# 12. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and decrements it by 1.



# 13. Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user: a number and a value. Increment the number by the given value.

# int1 = int(input("Enter number: "))

# int2 = int(input("Enter value number: "))

# formula = int1 + int2

# print(formula)


# 14. Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user: a number and a value. Decrement the number by the given value.



# 15. Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and checks if the string is empty.

# user_input = input("Enter a string: ")

# if not(user_input) or user_input == "":
#     print("The string is empty")
# else:
#     print("The string is not empty")


# 16. Write a Python program that takes a string input from the user and checks if the string is not empty.


# 17. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if the number is both even and positive.


# 18. Write a Python program that takes an integer input from the user and checks if the number is either odd or negative.
# 19. Write a Python program that takes two integer inputs from the user and checks if the numbers are equal.
# 20. Write a Python program that takes two string inputs from the user and checks if both strings are equal.
